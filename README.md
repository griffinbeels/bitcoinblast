# bitcoinblast

Griffin Beels and Sebastien Jean-Pierre -- together, we made BitcoinBlast.  There is still a lot we want to improve on with
this game, and we believe there is definitely a lot to do.  Hopefully we can use this as a further project to improve coding skills related to swift.  

# why

We created this game as a final project for our class on video games, in second semester, at Brown University.  The goal of this project was not to construct a groundbreaking game; rather, it was to explore a new coding language, learn about something new, and create a deliverable that we are able to say "Hey!  We made that!" about.

# How to play

Download the game, run it on your phone.  Basically, you just fire PogChamps from your Kappas and hit some Failfishes.  You never can win, but you can gain the satisfaction of improving in levels and strength and money!
